The program DrillSplit allows dividing the NC program into blocks to have the opportunity to control the tool condition during the drilling big amount of holes. 
For example, we need to drill 1000 holes in the aluminium part 1.6 mm diameter and 10 mm depth. 
We've got the NC program delivered from CAM system that executing continuously without a stop to control the tool condition. 
We need to stop the program every 100 blocks by moving to the safe position and turning off the coolant. 
The DrillSplit program can help us to solve that task. 
We open the NC file of a source program then set up the number of blocks to divide (Split Number equals 100 in our example) then change the inserting blocs in a row above the status bar if necessary and then press the Split button. 
After the end of the dividing procedure, we can save the result NC file.
